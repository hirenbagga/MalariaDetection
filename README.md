# MalariaDetection
My final project for the MIT Professional Education Applied Data Science course.

This project was originally completed in Google Colab, so there may be some comments which refer to Google Colab features, and the data's file path may need to be changed when you download this locally. I'm pretty sure I've fixed these potential issues, but if it doesn't work correctly, this is how the issues should be resolved.

The data is contained in the cell_images.zip file

The original jupyter notebook is MalariaDetection.ipynb and the static html file with my results is saved as MalariaDetection.html
